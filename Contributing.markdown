If you find a mistake or would like to contribute a translation, please open a pull request.

English is the reference translation. **Please don't include the comments from the English file in your translation.** Make a new folder called `XX.lproj` where `XX` is your language code. Copy `en.lproj/Localizable.strings` into your new folder and translate that. Don't forget to add yourself to the readme too! :smile:

If you are changing a previous translation, please explain why.

If you need help with anything, please email <sam@getsharesapp.com>. Thanks!
